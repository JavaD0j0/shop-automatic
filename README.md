# BookAutomatic

### Description
Are you tired of having to open up your browser and type the airline page you are looking for?
If the answer is Yes, then stop doing that and instead opt to use this automated application that does all that for you.

Just enter the airline webpage (or third-party booking site) you want to look for available flights and also provide your username and password
(do not worry, everything is encrypted) and then let the application automate all the steps to find you an available
flight that fits your journey.

<b>Enjoy!</b>
