# ShopAutomatic

### Description
Are you tired of having to open up your browser and then type your desired shopping webpage? Moreover, have to open different tabs of different sites
to search for the same item again multiple times?
If the answer is YES, then stop doing that and instead opt to use this automated application that does all that for you.

Just select the shopping webpage (or opt to search in all available sites) where you want to look for the item and also provide your username and 
password (do not worry, everything is encrypted) and then let the application automate all the steps to find you an available item.

<b>Enjoy!</b>
